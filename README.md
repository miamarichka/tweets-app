# User Card Application

This project is a user card application built using Vite and React. It allows users to view and interact with user cards, including following and unfollowing users.

## Features

#Clicking the "Follow" button toggles the follow status of a user and updates the follower count. 
#The follow button text and color change according to the follow status. 
#User actions are persisted across page refreshes. 
#Pagination is implemented to load additional user cards. 
#Filter functionality is available to show all tweets, only followed tweets, or only unfollowed tweets. 
#Routing is implemented using React Router. 
#Back button is available on the tweets page to navigate back to the home page.
